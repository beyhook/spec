## About

This document aims to describe an online encyclopedia, focusing on the visual representation of a chronological sequence of events. It supports a wide range of history (1.8 B years ago, until now), allowing users to explore the universe's history using a map and a timeline.
Data will be provided by contributors and scrapping online websites(e.g. Wikipedia).
